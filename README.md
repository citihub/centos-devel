# Citihub Development Docker image

## üí°Motivation
The goal is to create a **minimalist** and **lightweight** image with development tools in order to reduce network and storage impact.

This image gives you the flexibility to be used for development or as a base image as you see fits.

This image uses a non-root user with a UID and GID of 1001 to conform with docker security best practices.

## üöÄ Usage

### Launch the CLI
Simply launch the container and use the CLI as you would on any other platform, for instance using the latest image:

```bash
docker container run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/workspace citihub/centos-devel:latest
```

> The `--rm` flag will completely destroy the container and its data on exit.

### Build the image
You can build the image locally directly from the Dockerfile, using the build script.

It will :
* Lint the Dockerfile with [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint);
* Build and tag the image `citihub/centos-devel:dev`;
* Execute [container structure tests](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test) on the image.

```bash
# launch build script
./dev-build.sh
```
